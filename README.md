# Date Comparison Methods Demo

An interactive tool to demonstrate different approaches for comparing "today's sales to the same day of the week last year" in business reporting.

## Purpose

When clients request reports comparing current performance to "the same day of the week last year," there are actually multiple ways to interpret this requirement. This demo helps visualize the differences between each approach so you can choose the right method for your specific business needs.

## Methods Compared

1. **Same Nth Weekday of Year** - Find the nth occurrence of this weekday in last year
2. **Same Weekday of Same Week Number** - Same weekday of the same week number last year
3. **Same Nth Weekday of Same Month** - Same occurrence of weekday within the same month last year
4. **Same Weekday, Closest Date** - Closest same weekday to the anniversary date
5. **Same Calendar Date** - Simple anniversary date (most common)
